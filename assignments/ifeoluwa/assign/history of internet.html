        Question 2: History of Internet
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">
        The Internet is a structured, organized system. We begin with a brief history of the Internet.
        In the mid-1960s, mainframe computers in research organizations were stand-alone devices.
        Computers from different manufacturers were unable to communicate with one another.
        The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the Department of Defence (DoD) was interested in finding a way to connect computers so that the researchers they funded could share their findings,
        thereby reducing costs and eliminating duplication of effort.

    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">
        In 1967, at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) meeting, ARPA presented its ideas for ARPANET,
        a small network of connected computers. The idea was that each host computer (not necessarily from the same manufacturer)
        would be attached to a specialized computer, called an interface message processor (IMP).
        The IMPs, in turn, would be connected to another. Each IMP had to be able to communicate with other IMPs as well as with its own attached host.
        By 1969, ARPANET was a reality. Four nodes, at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA),
        the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford Research Institute (SRI),
        and the University of Utah, were connected via the IMPs to form a network.
        Software called the Network Control Protocol (NCP) provided communication between the hosts.

    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">
        In 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core ARPANET group,
        collaborated on what they called the Internetting Project. Cerf and Kahn's land-mark 1973 paper
        outlined the protocols to achieve end-to-end delivery of packets. This paper on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
        included concepts such as encapsulation, the datagram, and the functions of a gateway.
        Shortly thereafter, authorities made a decision to split TCP into two protocols:
        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internetworking Protocol (IP).
        IP would handle datagram routing while TCP would be responsible for higher-level functions such as segmentation, reassembly, and error detection.
        The internetworking protocol became known as TCP/IP.

        The Internet today is not a simple hierarchical structure. It is made up of many wide- and local-area networks
        joined by connecting devices and switching stations. It is difficult to give an accurate representation of the Internet because it is continually changing--new networks are being added,
        existing networks are adding addresses, and networks of defunct companies are being removed.
        Today most end users who want Internet connection use the services of Internet service providers (ISPs).
        There are international service providers, national service providers, regional service providers, and local service providers.
        The Internet today is run by private companies, not the government.
