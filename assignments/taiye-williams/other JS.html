    <h1>Other Streaming Languages Apart from JavaScript</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Dart</h2>
        <p>
            Dart is a Google product â€“ an object-oriented programming language similar to C, created as a replacement for JavaScript. If you have experience with Java, C, or C++, you might prefer Dart over JavaScript. It offers a more traditional OOP approach unlike JavaScript's prototype system. It's designed for productivity, though still has fewer capabilities than JS.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. TypeScript</h2>
        <p>
            Developed by Microsoft to enhance JavaScript's capabilities. TypeScript adds new features and supports backwards compatibility with JavaScript. It compiles to JS and supports Node.js as well.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. CoffeeScript</h2>
        <p>
            CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript and makes code shorter and easier to read. It supports advanced features like list comprehensions and classes. However, JS knowledge is still needed.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Elm</h2>
        <p>
            Elm is a functional language mostly used for frontend UI development. It has simple syntax, efficient debugging, and compiles to JavaScript.
