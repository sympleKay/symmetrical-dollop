    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>
    <h2>Question 3: History of JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
        JavaScript was created in <b>1995</b> by <b>Brendan Eich</b> while working at Netscape. 
        It was first released with Netscape 2 and later became the official 
        <b>ECMA-262 standard</b> in 1997. 
        After Netscape handed JavaScript to ECMA, the Mozilla Foundation continued its development 
        for the Firefox browser. Mozilla’s last version, 1.8.5, was equivalent to ES5. 
        Internet Explorer 4 (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMAScript Edition 1 (ES1).

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Internet Explorer 9 did not support ES5 <code>"use strict"</code>.</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer 11 does not fully support ES6.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ECMA Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</h3>
    <p>
        In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international 
        standards organization, where <b>Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</b> was formed 
        to develop the language further.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2008, during a TC39 meeting in Oslo to discuss ECMAScript 4, two opposing camps formed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:</b> Microsoft and Yahoo — preferred small, incremental upgrades.</li>
        <li><b>ECMAScript 4 Camp:</b> Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google — wanted a major upgrade.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On August 13, 2008, Brendan Eich announced the compromise:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ECMAScript 4 was dropped and rebranded as ES5.</li>
        <li>ES5 became an incremental upgrade of ES3.</li>
        <li>Some ES4 features were deferred to future releases.</li>
        <li>Work began on ES6, codenamed <b>Harmony</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        ES5 was released in 2009 and quickly became a huge success, with 
        all major browsers fully supporting it by 2013.
