    <h1>Question 3: History of JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla Foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5 (identical to ES5). Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

        <li>* Internet Explorer 9 did not support ES5 "use strict".</li>
        <li>** Internet Explorer 11 does not support ES6 fully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The ECMA Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</h3>
    <p>
        In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization. A technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2008, when the TC39 committee met in Oslo to discuss ECMAScript 4, they were divided into two camps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp: Microsoft and Yahoo wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.</li>
        <li>The ECMAScript 4 Camp: Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google wanted a major upgrade (ES4).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On August 13, 2008, Brendan Eich announced the resolution:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5.</li>
        <li>ES5 would be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.</li>
        <li>Features of ES4 would be picked up in future versions.</li>
        <li>Work would begin on a new major release (ES6), codenamed "Harmony".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers were fully compliant by 2013.
